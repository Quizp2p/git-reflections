1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  Git will create the meta data about this new repository in .git directory,
  otherwise git will not know that current directory is a new repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
  repository? What value do you think it offers?
  Staging area get track of the files user chose to commit, it provides a cache
  for users to decide which of the files they want to keep tracking with git.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
  change?
  To make sure we have one commit per logical change, we can add the changed
  files which are related to the logical change to the staging area, and leave
  the rest as is.

  4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
    history organized? How would branches help?
    When there are code changes need to be keeping tracked, but you don't want
    them mess up with the stable code on the master branch. They side code
    changes would also be tracked in their own branch, while the master branch
    stay intact.

  5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    It's much more intuitive then the log messages only to figure out the
    history and relationships between the branches.

  6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent
    it in the diagram the way we do?
    The result is a merged commit in the branch which was merged into. It is
    a representation of two stream of branches combine into one.
