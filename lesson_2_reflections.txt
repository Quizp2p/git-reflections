1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  Git will create the meta data about this new repository in .git directory,
  otherwise git will not know that current directory is a new repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
  repository? What value do you think it offers?
  Staging area get track of the files user chose to commit, it provides a cache
  for users to decide which of the files they want to keep tracking with git.
