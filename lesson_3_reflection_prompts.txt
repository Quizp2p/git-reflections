1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
  work local?
  When I have to work on different computers on different locations and when I
  want to share the project or collaborate with other people on the project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  My local repository might be more up-to-date than the remote one, and also
  there may be some branches I don't want to share on the remote yet.
