1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
  work local?
  When I have to work on different computers on different locations and when I
  want to share the project or collaborate with other people on the project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  My local repository might be more up-to-date than the remote one, and also
  there may be some branches I don't want to share on the remote yet.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
 use one instead of another?
 Forks are clones made on Github servers, they will show the relationships to
 the origin projects, while clones could be done remotely or locally and the
 cloned repo will be set to the newly cloned repo's remote as origin. Branches
 are just local labels for different commit streams.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
Git will get to know wether your commits are in sync with remote repo.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
Without Git we could only use the cloud drives, of course Git will be much
easier.

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
 in master? What benefits does each approach have?
 When work on an experiment feature or fixing a but or collaborate with other
 team members, it will avoid a lot of conflicts in code base but it's more
 tedious.
